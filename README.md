### Unified Catalog integrations
This repo provides a set of assets that can help you automate the discovery of all integration assets and APIs, from across multiple environments, such as Azure, and publish them in a centralized catalog to drive consumption and reuse of your existing APIs. These environments can also be repositories such as GitHub, SwaggerHub.

AMPLIFY Unified Catalog  provides event-driven subscription management capabilities, that can enable you to create custom subscription flows for each registered environment, enabling complex approval flows and integration with existing systems to streamline experience and reduce time for approval. The full capabilities of the Unified Catalog are available through CLI to automate the discovery and management of your APIs in the Catalog.

You can benefit from this: 
* if you have APIs that are spread across multiple gateways from multiple vendors, such as Azure or Mulesoft
* lack visibility into all your integrations assets and need to have a holistic view of all your APIs
* need to implement a multi-step approval process and integrate with third party systems such as Microsoft Teams.
