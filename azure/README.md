### Discover APIs from Azure API Management and configure custom approval flows


The basic use case is as follows:

**API Provider**
* Will publish APIs from Azure API Management into the Unified Catalog via script.  Those APIs will require manual approval of subscription requests from consumers.
* Is notified in Microsoft Teams when there is a new subscription requests, and will approve or reject the request. 

**API Consumer**
* Discovers the API in the Unified Catalog and request access by subscribing.
* On approval, a subscription key will be created in Azure API Management and the key will be sent to the API Consumer's email. After the key has been sent, the state of the Subscription in Unified Catalog gets updated to Active and the Consumer can now use the API with the key that was received over email. 
* Can cancel the subscription from the Unified Catalog. When cancelled, the subscription in Azure Management will be removed and the state of the Unified Catalog will be updated to unsubscribed, indicating the consumer will no longer be able to use the API with the key received.

The technologies that were used for this project: 

* [Amplify Unified Catalog](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/axway-open-docs/page/docs/catalog/index.html) as the central place to publish and discover the APIs. 
* [Amplify Central CLI](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/amplify-central/page/docs/integrate_with_central/cli_central/cli_install/index.html) to fetch the APIs from Azure API Management and promote them to the Unified Catalog. 
* [Integration Builder](https://www.axway.com/en/products/application-integration) to implement the logic for the subscription management and email notifications. 
* MS Teams for notifications and approval or rejection of subscription requests. 
* Azure API Management.

Follow the steps below to use this example: 


### Step 1: Create Platform Service Account (using Client Secret)

The Service Account can be created using the [Platform UI](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/platform-management/page/docs/management_guide/organizations/managing_organizations/index.html#managing-service-accounts) or the [Axway CLI](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/axwaycli-open-docs/page/docs/authentication/service_accounts/index.html)

More details on how to achieve this are also presented in this [blog post](https://blog.axway.com/apis/axway-amplify-platform-api-calls).

After creating the Service Account, save the **clientId** and **clientSecret**.

### Step 2: Create a Service Principal in Azure API Management using the CLI
***

This will be used to authenticate to Azure API Management. 

1. Install the CLI: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest. 
2. After you install the CLI, run `az login` command. You will be redirected to login with to your Azure account. 
3. Once logged in, run `az ad sp create-for-rbac -n ""http://your_service_principal_name"` command. The result should contain the tenantId and password. See example: 
   ```powershell
   Creating a role assignment under the scope of "/subscriptions/b3700142-5855-4c3c-b8a0-ff1bbda1d53e"
    Retrying role assignment creation: 1/36
   {
     "appId": "f4b7a269-******",
     "displayName": "cataog-integration",
     "name": "http://catalog-integration",
     "password": "63c9503f-*****",
     "tenant": "300f59df-*******"
   }
   ```
   
 When you create the Azure principal the return gives you info you're going to need later. If you happen to lose the info, you can retrieve it again with the following command:   `az ad sp list --filter "displayname eq 'service-principal'`, where `service-principal` is the name of the principal you created.   
 
Note: If you have more than one subscriptions with your Azure account, run the following command `az account set --subscription "subcription_name`. You need to have at least Owner rights to be able to create the Service principal account. 

4. Retrieve your subscription id with `az account show --query id`. You will use this value later in the Integration Builder flow. 

### Step 3: Configure Integration Builder flow to update subscriptions and send email notifications
***

This Integration Builder flow will receive the approve or reject requests from Microsoft Teams and unsubscribe requests from Unified Catalog, then will subscribe / unsubscribe the consumer to the APIs in Azure API Management and updates the Subscription states in Unified Catalog.. It will also send email notifications to the user with the key to authenticate the API calls.

Flow these steps to configure the flow: 
1. Download the [Azure Registration Flow.json](https://github.com/Axway/mulesoft-catalog-integration/blob/master/azure/Azure%20Registration%20Flow.json). 
2. Navigate to [Integration Builder](https://sandbox-ib.platform.axway.com/welcome) on the [Amplify Platform](https://platform.axway.com/).  
3. Import the flow as a **Flow template**. 
   * Go to `Flows`, click on `Build New Flow`. 
   * Select `Import` and choose the flow that you downloaded in the previous step.  
   * Provide a `Name` and click on `Create' to save your flow template. 
4. Configure a **Connector instance** to send email notifications to Outlook. 
   * From `Connectors`, search for `Outlook Email` connector in the search box.
   * Select the `Outlook Email` connector and click `Authenticate`. 
   * Provide a `Name` and click on `Create instance`. You will be redirected to authenticate with your Outlook credentials.
   * Go to `Instances` and look for the connector instance that you just created. 
5. Create a **flow instance** to replace the Value variables in the template with specific values to connect to your AZURE API Management environment and platform tenant. 
* Navigate to `Flows`, select your flow template and click `Create Instance'. 
* Provide a `Name` for the instance. 
* Select the `outlookEmail` connector instance that you created at Step 4. 
* Provide values for all required Variables:
  * `axwayClientId`: The `clientId` from Axway Service Account. Please refer to _Step 1: Create Amplify Central Service Account_.
  * `axwayClientSecret`: The `clientSecret` from Axway Service Account. Please refer to _Step 1: Create Amplify Central Service Account_.
  * `axwayTenantId`: The organization id of your Amplify account.
  * `azureTenantId`: The tenant id of your Azure account. 
  * `azureClientId`: The `appId`from the Azure service principal.  
  * `azureClientSecret`: The `password` from the Azure service principal.
  * `subId`: The subscription id of your Azure account, that you retrieved with `az account set --subscription "subcription_name` command at Step1. 
   
**Watch the [demo video](https://youtu.be/1XoxMYIj98M) as we break down and explain how to import and configure the flow template.**

### Step 4: Configure Microsoft Teams flow to Approve / Reject subscription requests
***

**Amplify Central Unified Catalog** has the option to configure Webhooks that can be invoked when Consumers of Catalog asset update their subscriptions.This flow will send notifications to MS teams channel as an Active card when a consumer subscribes to the API from the Unified Catalog. The API provider can then approve or reject the subscription requests from within the MS Active card. This action will trigger the Integration Builder flow, as a post execution step. 
The MS flow will also post notifications in the channel for any subscription updates.

**Pre-requisite:** 
* You'll need [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com), with a Free Trial account at a minimum to be able to create the flow. 

**To configure the flow:**

1. Navigate to [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com).
2. Create the Webhook entry point that Unified Catalog will send the events to. 
    * Go to "My flows". 
    * Create an `Instant flow`, provide a `name` and select `When an HTTP request is received` as an entry point.
    * In the request json body schema, copy and paste the Subscription Updated Event schema below:

4. Set up the Adaptive card. The subscription requests will be Approved or Rejected based on the response of the action in the Adaptive Card. 
   * On the `If yes` branch, select `Add a new action` of type `Post an Adaptive Card to a Teams channel and wait for the response`.
   * Configure the `Team` and the `Channel` where the card would be posted.
   * Copy-paste the text below in `Message` box:

   * Set the `Update Message` to: 
 ```js
Subscription "@{triggerBody()?['payload']?['subscription']?['name']}" processed for "@{triggerBody()?['payload']?['catalogItem']?['name']}"
```
   * Set the `Should update card` to `yes`.

5. Add an action of type `HTTP` to configure calling to Integration Builder

   * Set `Method`to `POST`
   * Set `URI`to `https://staging.cloud-elements.com/elements/api-v2/formulas/instances/{FLOW_INSTANCE_ID_HERE}/executions`. Please make sure to replace {FLOW_INSTANCE_ID_HERE} with the Flow Instance ID created at Step 3: Configure Integration Builder flow to update subscriptions and send email notifications. 
   * Set `Headers`to `Content-Type: application/json`<p/>
   * Set the `Body`to
    
    ```js
    {
    "catalogItem": {
        "id": "@{triggerBody()?['payload']?['catalogItem']?['id']}",
        "name": "@{triggerBody()?['payload']?['catalogItem']?['name']}",
        "relationships": @{triggerBody()?['payload']?['catalogItem']?['relationships']}
    },
    "subscription": {
        "id": "@{triggerBody()?['payload']?['subscription']?['id']}",
        "action": "@{body('Post_an_Adaptive_Card_to_a_Teams_channel_and_wait_for_a_response')?['data']?['action']}",

        "relationships": @{triggerBody()?['payload']?['subscription']?['relationships']},
        "properties": @{triggerBody()?['payload']?['subscription']?['properties']}
    }
    }
    ```
    
    * Click on `Show advanced options` and set `Authorization` to `Raw`, value being your Integration Builder User and Org secrets: `User ****, Organization ****`

![](https://github.com/Axway/mulesoft-catalog-integration/blob/master/images/MSFlow-Step5.PNG)

6. Add a new Microsoft Teams action as `Post a message as the Flow bot to a channel`. 
   * Select the `Team` and the `Channel`
   * Set the `Message` field to:

    ```js
    Subscription "@{triggerBody()?['payload']?['subscription']?['name']}" on "@{triggerBody()?['payload']?['catalogItem']?['name']}" was sent to be @{body('Post_an_Adaptive_Card_to_a_Teams_channel_and_wait_for_a_response')?['data']?['action']} by "@{body('Post_an_Adaptive_Card_to_a_Teams_channel_and_wait_for_a_response')?['responder']?['displayName']}" (@{body('Post_an_Adaptive_Card_to_a_Teams_channel_and_wait_for_a_response')?['responder']?['email']})
    ```

7. Set up the `If no` branch.
    The flow will always post a message to a teams channel when a subscription state changes and the current state is different than `REQUESTED`.
    * Select `Post a message as the Flow bot to a channel` action. 
    * Pick the `Team` and `Channel`
    * Set the `Message` field to:

    ```js
    Subscription "@{triggerBody()?['payload']?['subscription']?['name']}" for "@{triggerBody()?['payload']?['catalogItem']?['name']}" state changed to @{triggerBody()?['payload']?['subscription']?['currentState']}
    ```

10. Save the flow

Watch the [demo video](https://youtu.be/yGwK9_y-GCU) as we break down and explain how to import and configure the flow template.


### Step 5: Install and configure the @axway/amplify-central-azure-extension 
___

CLI extension that fetches the APIs from Azure API Management and builds the resources needed to publish to the Amplify Unified Catalog.  The following set of resources were configured. 

* **Environment** groups the set of APIs that are fetched from Azure API Management. An environment represents the logical grouping of APIs. 
* **Webhook** defines the webhook URL that will be invoked to post a notification in Microsoft Teams and update the subscription in Azure API Management.
* **Secret** provides key value pairs of named secrets that are used to secure your webhooks. Setting a webhook secret allows you to ensure that POST requests sent to the payload URL are from Axway. 
* **ConsumerSubscriptionDefinition** allows the configuration of the data needed from a consumer to subscribe to the API from the Unified Catalog.  It also has a reference to the webhook that will get invoked on subscription, and it is referenced in the ConsumerInstance resources. 
* **APIService** holds all the information needed to represent your API (image, description, markdown documentation etc). 
* **APIServiceRevision** holds the OAS specification file. Multiple revisions can be created. 
* **APIServiceInstance** contains the endpoints (host and port information) where the API is deployed.
* **ConsumerInstance**  contains all the details for creating the asset in the Unified Catalog. It also contains a reference to the ConsumerSubscriptionDefinition that has the link to the webhook. That means that for each Subscription Update event generated from Unified Catalog related to the Catalog Item created from the ConsumerInstance, the webhook will get invoked

The above resources structure map to the API Server REST API resources as defined in the API Server [OAS3 specs](https://apicentral.axway.com/apis/docs).

Before you proceed, you can check the full list of supported commands [here](https://github.com/Axway/unified-catalog-integrations/tree/1b598aaf57c4b51af1129edf597b254efc8c035a/azure/azure-extension/README.md).

**1. Install @axway/azure-extension**

Assuming you are familiar with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com), you should first install the [Axway CLI](https://npmjs.com/package/axway), which will give you connectivity to the [Axway Amplify Platform](https://www.axway.com/en/products/amplify). Note that you must first have an account on [https://platform.axway.com](https://platform.axway.com/), and be provisioned in Amplify Central. 

```powershell
[sudo] npm install -g axway
```

Use the Amplify package manager command to install the Amplify Central CLI:

```powershell
axway pm install @axway/axway-central-cli
```

You can then install the @axway/amplify-central-azure-extension:

```powershell
npm install @axway/amplify-central-azure-extension
```

The installation would present the command to add this extension to the Amplify Central CLI following this template:

```powershell
axway central config set extensions.azure-extension <path to where you installed the extension>
```

To verify if the CLI extension was successfully set, you can run: `axway central azure-extension config -h`.

**2. Configure extension**

Configure the extension prior to generating the resources. 

# Getting started

You must be logged into the Axway Amplify Platform before uploading any generated resource files. 
Refer to the Axway Central CLI [documentation](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/amplify-central/page/docs/integrate_with_central/cli_central/cli_install/index.html) for more information.

* Log in to the [Axway Amplify Platform](https://www.axway.com/en/products/amplify) using the following command:
```powershell
axway auth login --client-id <Service Account> --secret-file <private_key_for_service_account>
```
Example: `axway auth login --client-id DOSA_105cf15d051c432c8cd2e1313f54c2da --secret-file ~/test/private_key.pem`
 
* Set the output directory where you want the resources to be generated. 
```powershell
axway central azure-extension config set --output-dir=<directory_name>
```
Example: `axway central azure-extension config set --output-dir="./azure-resources"`.

* Set the environment name: 
```powershell
axway central azure-extension config set --environment-name=<env_name>
```
Example: `axway central azure-extension config set --environment-name=azure-env`

* Set the image for the environment
```powershell
axway central azure-extension config set --icon=<path_to_your_image>
```

* Set the filtering option. Only APIs with this tag will be fetched from Azure. if there is no filter set, then all the apis will be fetched. 
```powershell
axway central azure-extension config set --filter="tags=<tag_value>"
```
Example: `axway central azure-extension config set --filter="tags=unifiedcatalog"`. Please make sure the APIs in Azure are tagged correctly with the value set with the filter command. 

![Set API tags](https://github.com/Axway/unified-catalog-integrations/blob/master/images/AzureAPISetTags.png)


* Set the Webhook URL to send the HTTP POST request for a subcription update event.
```powershell
axway central azure-extension config set --webhook-url="MS_FLOW_HTTP_POST_URL"
```
  
* Set your Azure Subcription Id. This will be the value of the **subscription id** from you service principal account configured at _Step 2: Create a Service Principal in Azure API Management using the CLI_
```powershell
axway central azure-extension config set --subscription-id=<your_azure_subscription_id>
```

* Set the Azure Client Id. This should be the **appId** from the service principal account configured at _Step 2: Create a Service Principal in Azure API Management using the CLI_.

```powershell
axway central azure-extension config set --client-id=<your_azure_client_id>
```
  
* Set the Azure Client Secret. This should be the **password** from the service principal account configured at _Step 2: Create a Service Principal in Azure API Management using the CLI_.
```powershell
axway central azure-extension config set --client-secret=<your_azure_client_secret>
```

* Set the Azure Tenant Id. This will be the **tenant id** from the service principal account configured at _Step 2: Create a Service Principal in Azure API Management using the CLI_.
```powershell
axway central azure-extension config set --tenant-id=<your_azure_tenant_id>
```

* Set the Azure Service name. The **service name** of your API Management service in Azure Portal. Please refer to [Azure API Management service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/get-started-create-service-instance).
```powershell
axway central azure-extension config set --service-name=<your_azure_service_name>
```

* Set the Azure Resource Group name. The **resource group name** under your API Management service in Azure Portal. Please refer to [Azure API Management service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/get-started-create-service-instance).
```powershell
axway central azure-extension config set --resource-group-name=<your_azure_resource_group_name>
```

![Azure API Management Service](https://github.com/Axway/unified-catalog-integrations/blob/master/images/AzureAPIManagementService.png).

 You can run `axway central azure-extension config` to see the azure-extension configuration.  
 
**3. Generate Amplify Central resources**`

The generate command will create Amplify Central resource files for your configured Azure instances. These files will be generated into either `./resources` or the directory you configured with the `--output-dir` configuration setting. 

```
axway central azure-extension resources generate
```

**4. Publish to Unified Catalog**

After generating these files you can modify and upload them to Amplify Central with the `axway central create -f=<file>` command. You'll want be sure to upload any Environment files before other generated resources.

Create the Environment in Amplify Central.

```powershell
# Upload the Environment, Webhook, and ConsumerSubscriptionDefinition
axway central create --file=<path_to_environment_file>
```
Import the APIs in Amplify Central and publish them to the Unified Catalog. You need to run this command for each _service_yaml_ file. 

```powershell
# Upload the APIService, APIServiceRevision, APIServiceInstance, and ConsumerInstance
axway central create -f=~<path_to_service_yaml_file>
```

**Example**

```powershell
# Upload the Environment, Webhook, and ConsumerSubscriptionDefinition
axway central create -f=~/Desktop/Environment.yaml
# Upload the APIService, APIServiceRevision, APIServiceInstance, and ConsumerInstance
axway central create -f=~/Desktop/APIService-swagger-petstore.yaml
```
